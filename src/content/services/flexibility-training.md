# Unlock Your Range of Motion

Flexibility training is often overlooked but is crucial for injury prevention and maximizing performance. Our coaches specialize in a variety of techniques designed to restore balance and improve your movement quality.

### Techniques We Utilize

1.  **Dynamic Stretching:** Preparation for activity, focusing on controlled, repetitive movements.
2.  **PNF (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation):** Advanced stretching that combines passive stretching and isometric contractions for rapid gains.
3.  **Myofascial Release:** Techniques using foam rollers or manual pressure to target trigger points and relieve muscle tension.

Whether you're recovering from an injury or just want to feel less stiff after a long day at your desk, dedicated flexibility work is key.
